          <h1><u>Introduction</u></h1>
          <p>The female population of the world as per 2017 is 49.5%, where 81 of the countries have higher population of female, 36 countries have higher population of male and 75 countries are within the 0.5% gender parity. Irrespective of constituting half the world population but when it comes to the world of politics, it is still male who dominates. As per United Nations, world-wide average of women participation in parliament is a mere 23.4% which brings us to the most important question, why is it very low.</p>
         </div>
        <div id='womeninpolitics'>
            
            <h1>What is the women participation in politics in every region?</h1>
            <p>To answer this question why women participation is low, we started by looking at the data on the average women participation in National Parliaments for each region for the period between 1997 to 2017. We can see that the Asian and African regions had very low women participation in 1997 which gradually increased over the two decades. Australia and European regions had very good women participation even in 1997 which also increased over the period of 20 years and surpassing the global average of women participation. In South America, we can see there is a drastic jump from 20.35 in 2013 to 24.06 in 2014 and ended up being the region with the most progress between 1997 and 2017 with a 16.5% increase of women participation in politics. </p>

            <h1>How much the percentage of women participation increased for every country since 1997?</h1>
            <p>The Region wise analysis of women participation turned out to be a dismal situation. So, we decided to further deep dive and look at the individual countries how they were at 1997 and 2017. Event though it is very encouraging to witness the participation increased from 1997 to 2017 for 95% of the countries, we could not help but notice that participation decreased in few countries. So, we decided to take a closer look at the countries where actually the women participation dipped in 2017 when compared to 1997.</p>
        	  <b><u>Key Points:</u></b>
	         <ul>
	<li>    15 countries had zero women representation in politics in 1997</li>
	<li>    Out of the 112 countries listed here, 62 countries had less than 10% women participation in 1997 whereas only 11 countries had less than 10% women participation in politics in 2017</li> 
	<li>    17 countries had women participation greater than 20% in 1997</li>
	<li>    53 countries have more women participation than the world-wide average women participation rate of 23.4% in 2017</li>
	<li>    Sweden had the highest women participation in 1997 with 40.4% and Rwanda had the highest women participation in 2017 with 61.3%</li>
</ul>

        <h1>What are the top and bottom countries with higher rate of women participation?</h1>
<p>Here are the top 5 countries with the highest increase in women participation and bottom 5 countries with the lowest increase (actually decrease!) in women participation over the two decades. The country with the highest progress is Bolivia and the country with the lowest progress is Mali. Bolivia which had zero women participation in 1997 has drastically improved its women participation in the last twenty years emerging as the leader when setting an example to the rest of country about giving equal importance to women in politics, thereby indirectly highlighting the importance of giving women her rightful place in the decision-making process. It is interesting to see Rwanda, a country the region which had the lowest women participation in Politics in 1997 making to the top 5 list. 4 out of 5 countries in the top list belong to the South American Region. These findings are a wake-up call to us. It shows how we lag in terms of female participation that too currently when technological advancement is at its peak.  It is in fact an irony to see high income countries, where the economic status and health conditions are good being featured in the bottom 5 list.  There is not even one country from high income group in the top 5 list. 4 out of 5 countries in top 5 list belong to middle income group.</p>

<div id='factors'>
    <h1>What are the factors that influenced women in politics?</h1>
    <p>Next step, we decided to dive deep into the many factors that influence women’s entry into politics like Life expectancy, Fertility, Female Self Employment Score, Percentage of Women Population and Female Labour Percentage for the top 5 and bottom 5 countries. </p>
<p>
<b><u>Key Points:</u></b>
<ul>
<li>	For the bottom 5, irrespective of the increase in female population, the female labour rate decreased by a whooping 11.64% and Self- Employment rate decreased by 11.54% </li>
<li>	Women Representation in parliament decrased from 10.5 to 8.64% for the bottom 5.</li>
<li>	In terms of Heath factors, the life expectnacy of women also increased from from 64.85 to 68.94 years but fertility decreased from 3.38 to 2.72</li>
<li>	For the top 5 countries, female population decreased by 0.11% but life expectnacy of women increased from 63.10 years to 70.86 years. Hoever, Fertility rate dipped to 2.75 in 2017.</li>
<li>	Female Labour increased by 1% and Self Employment did not change over the two decades.</li>
<li>	Women Particpation increased from 6.1% to 46% which is magnanious 280% increase for the top 5.</li>
It is very evident that Female employment played a key factor in women participation in politics.
</ul>

       <div id='genderquota'>
         
        <h1>How is the gender quota implementation worldwide?</h1>
        <p>“Quota Adoption and Reform Over Time QAROT” reveals that only 14 out of 220 countries have quota for women representation in 1997. In, 2017 the scenario has not changed drastically and still only 76 out of 220 countries have recognized women representation in parliament. It is very pathetic especially at this age where we see women venturing into every industry and excelling right from space to technology to business. 
</p><p>It is a surprise to see that irrespective of huge women representation in Europe, still countries like Sweden which had the highest women participation in the world 1997 does not have a quota for women. Countries like Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Luxemburg, France, Italy and Austria where women occupy more than 30% of the seats in national parliaments still have to fight for their quota. It is a very sad situation. 
  </p><p>Another big surprise is from the Australian and North American region where still there is no quota for women at all. Africa, Asia and South America regions still have half the countries where gender quota is not implemented.
    </p><p>Thus, it is evident that irrespective of numerous factors influencing women participation it is the gender quota which has the most impact. Unless and until this is fixed, it will be long run before women take an active part in the decision-making process for the country!

</div>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Despite the progress in the long run, the top countries based on GDP are still hesitant to give recognition to their women when it comes to politics. Apart from the factors considered here, there are still many other factors like women voter turnout, literacy rate, violence against women etc. which determine women participation in politics. Gender Equality and Gender Quota are the top most factors.</p>
      <p>Thus, rightly quoted by Hillary Clinton on women representation in politics, “The best answer for sexism in politics is more women in politics”.</p>
